Terms of Services

Terms and Conditions

This Terms of Service ("Agreement") is a legally binding contract between Silvaway Solutions and you ("Customer," "you" or "your") that shall govern the purchase and use, in any manner, of the services provided by Silvaway Solutions to Customer (collectively, the "Services").

By purchasing and/or using the Services in any manner, you represent that you have read, understand, and agree to all terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and that you are at least eighteen (18) years old and have the legal ability to engage in a contract in the State of California.

If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, then you may not use any of the Services. If you are already a customer of Silvaway Solutions and do not agree with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, you should immediately contact Silvaway Solutions to cancel your Services.

Ownership and Services Purchased

The features and details of the Services governed by this Agreement are described on the web pages setting out the particular services or products you have purchased ("Service Description Page") based on their description on the Service Description Page as of the Effective Date, as defined below. Silvaway Solutions may modify the products and services it offers from time-to-time. Should the Service Description Page change subsequent to the Effective Date, we have no obligation to modify the Service to reflect such a change. The services and products provided to you by Silvaway Solutions as set out on the Service Description Page, are referred to as the "Services."

1.3. Certain aspects of the Services are provided by third parties. These third parties may have reserved the right to make changes, including material changes, to the services provided by them. You may terminate this Agreement if such a change materially affects the Services.

Term of Agreement

Obeying the Law
3.1. Silvaway Solutions is registered and located within the United States of America and as such, we are required to comply with the laws and official policies of the United States of America, regardless of where the Services are provided.

5.2. Silvaway Solutions is not responsible for any damages or losses as a result of suspension or termination for non-payment of your account. In addition, Silvaway Solutions reserves the right to refuse to re-activate your Services until any and all outstanding invoice(s) have been paid in full.

Refund Policy and Billing Disputes
6.1. Silvaway Solutions offers a thirty (30) day money back guarantee on shared web hosting packages. After the thirty (30) day money back guarantee, eligible plans are eligible for an account credit on a prorated basis. Such credits will have any previously extended term discounts withheld from the total credit amount and will be calculated based on the number of months remaining in your billing cycle. Silvaway Solutions offers a ten (10 day) money back guarantee from the day of purchase on website design and fulfillment packages. Beyond 10 days, no refunds are available for any reason, including, but not limited to dissatisfaction with the design process or dissatisfaction with the final product delivered to you.

6.2. No refunds are offered on 1-year contract offers, custom packages, setup fees, domain transfers, SSL certificates, advanced support fees, processing fees, or software licenses.

6.3. Only first-time accounts are eligible for a refund under the 30-day money back guarantee. For example, if you had or still have an account with Silvaway Solutions before, canceled and signed up again, you will not be eligible for a refund or if you have opened a second account with Silvaway Solutions In addition, refunds are not offered for accounts that are suspended or terminated for violating this Agreement.

In addition, Silvaway Solutions reserves the right to refuse a refund at any time for any or no reason.

Refusal of Service
8.1. Silvaway Solutions reserves the right to refuse service to anyone at any time.

Resource Usage
9.1. Each customer is required to utilize as little server resources as possible, so as to allow for reasonable performance by all Silvaway Solutions customers.

Such suspension or termination can occur at any time without prior warning, and for any or no reason.

9.2. Enforced resource limits for shared packages:

5% Memory Usage (or 512 MB)

So as to allow reasonable performance for all customers, individual customers are expected to demonstrate responsible resource usage of the Storage Area Network (disk throughput MB/s / disk IN/OUT operations per second), Hardware Virtual Machine CPU (Central Processor Unit Time), and any other shared resource not explicitly mentioned herein. Silvaway Solutions regularly monitors all Storage Area Networks and Hardware Virtual Machine CPU loads for normal usage patterns and routinely evaluates customer deployments for abnormal usage patterns. Silvaway Solutions reserves the right to suspend, terminate, and/or limit (such as through disk throughput limiting, in/out operation per second limiting and lowering of CPU priority) services on any account, that at its sole discretion, is using an abnormally large amount of shared resources. Such suspension, termination, or limitation can occur at any time without prior warning, and for any or no reason.

Bandwidth Usage
10.1. You are allocated a monthly bandwidth allowance depending on the hosting package you purchase.

10.2.

10.4. Like other resources, customers are expected to demonstrate responsible usage of bandwidth resources, so as to allow for reasonable performance by all Silvaway Solutions customers. Silvaway Solutions regularly monitors bandwidth usage and reserves the right to suspend, terminate, and/or limit (such as through port speed limiting) Services on any account, that at its sole discretion, is using an abnormally large amount of bandwidth.
